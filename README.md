# Trixie-and-Truls
A simple website for my comic Trixie and Truls, inspired by a class on Skillshare called “Hand-Code Your First Website: HTML + CSS Basics” by Rich Armstrong (TapTapKaboom).

This website uses simple HTML and CSS and I made it with my own comic "Trixie and Truls". The class project on Skillshare (https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/hand-code-your-first-website-html-css-basics/1575146775) was to make a simple website with our favorite superhero, but honestly, it feels more personal to use my own characters. And they are my superheroes, always!

This is what I came up with!
